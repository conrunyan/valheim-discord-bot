# Valheim Discord Bot

This discord bot is intended as tools to help quickly get information about your dedicated Valheim server. It currently only supports the Linux version, as that's the only dedicated server I've used up to this point. 

IMPORTANT NOTE: This bot needs to be running on the same server/container/etc. that your Valheim server is running.

## Getting Started

Setting up the discord bot involves a few steps, including creating a new application and bot on the Discord developer platform.

If you are new to creating a Discord Bot, the "discord.py" docs are very helpful.
